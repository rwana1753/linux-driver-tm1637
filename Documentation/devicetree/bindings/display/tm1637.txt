Titan Micro Electronics TM1637 RAM mapping 8*6 LED controller driver with keyscan
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Required properties:
  - compatible: Must contain "tm,tm1637",
  - clk-gpios: Must contain a GPIO specifier, referring to the GPIO pin
    connected to the "CLK" (Clock) signal line of the LED Controller's bus
    interface,
  - dio-gpios: Must contain a GPIO specifier, referring to the GPIO pin
    connected to the "DIO" (Data Input/Output) signal line of the LED Controller's bus
    interface,
  - delay-ns: Delay fo GPIO port, on bus interface.

Example:

	auxdisplay {
		compatible = "tm,tm1637";

		clk-gpios = <&gpio 3 0>;
		dio-gpios = <&gpio 2 0>;
		
		delay-ns = <100>;
	};

The TM1637 driver provides simple interfaces as below.
Valied values for <n> are between 0 and 5.
led<n>     : Write LED value is used for writing LED value
key        : Read Key value is read via the key matrix.
brightness : Control LED brightness
leds       : Switch on LED

For example, switch on LED in TM1637
echo on > /sys/bus/platform/devices/auxdisplay/leds

For example, write LED values in TM1637
echo 128 > /sys/bus/platform/devices/auxdisplay/led<n>

For example, read key value in TM1637
cat /sys/bus/platform/devices/auxdisplay/key

For example, control maximum brightness in TM1637
echo 7 >/sys/bus/platform/devices/auxdisplay/brightness
